## Common problems

**What is the recommended parameter of PID?**

*   It is recommended to adjust according to quick use instructions or video due to the differences of motors.</br>

**•	How to change the speed to the degree/ s? How to change the position to  degree?**

*   The speed unit is r/min, the position unit is r, convert the minute into second to calculate the angular velocity.</br>

**How to convert the current A after reading four bytes, is it sign int32?**

*   The current unit is A, the speed unit is RPM, and the position unit is R. The current value of the motor is represented by 4 bytes of data,2^24 times of the true value. The higher position is followed by lower position, not sign int32. _iq24 format.

**Is there a PC software that automatically generates a CRC command?**

*   The CRC can be captured using the serial port.</br>

**How long will it last with a rated current of 7A (torque 0.6Nm) and 800RPM?**

*   Pay attention to the inverter temperature and motor temperature. Its duration is related to heat dissipation, if the heat dissipation is good, the internal and external heat can get to balance so that it can work all the time. But if the motor casing exceeds 80℃, it is recommended to stop working.

**Current feedback is 20A but the current clamp measures the supply current is only 2.4A. Why?**

*   The phase current of the motor is different from the bus current.、

**Does current feedback refer to the peak phase current?**

*   yes</br>

**Is it a a DC brushless motor or a PMSM(permanent magnet synchronous motor)?**

*   BLDC</br>

**What is the current series torque coefficient of the QDD-PR60-36 series? **

*   33A corresponds to 2Nm, current and torque are linear relationship. The maximum current is 33A, the maximum is 2Nm.</br>

**The current can't reach 33A. Is the value of current if it is a little more than 30A going to stop? **

*   Increase the current limit value, 2Nm is the instantaneous maximum torque, and it can't work for a long time.</br>

**When the current is large, it stops after one turn?**

*   Look at the power supply, it may be that the power is not high enough</br>

**Fix the end and increase current will have the “Locked-rotorerror” error warning?**

*   It is the blocked error. The unit of the energy generated by the stalling error when motor blocked is Joule J. If the set value is exceeded, the actuator will be protected. The protection value can be set by the host computer, but it is not recommended to set a too large value. If it is blocked for a long time, the energy will be too high and the motor will be damaged.

**Is the current motor 5A equivalent to another motor 10A?**

*   It is the scaling problem displayed by the host computer, which does not affect the actual use. The ratio shown on upper computer is one time smaller than the original SCA. If the command is used correctly, then everything will be normal.</br>

**Will it occasionally have the problem of Overvoltageerror (when input voltage is 42V)?**

*   Check if a large capacitor is plugged into the HUB, because the actuator will generate while it is anti-drive. It needs to be plugged back into the feed capacitor.</br>

**In the speed loop mode, the motor does not respond regardless of the setting of the speed value. Error code: 0x0200**

*   It means that the step is too big. The speed mode step cannot be bigger than 600RPM.

**Occasionally Overvoltageerror occurs (the input voltage is 42V)?**

*   •	Please check if a large capacitor is plugged into the HUB

**Is it possible to control immediately after the motor is blocked?**

*   Clear error alarms to control it</br>

**Limit minimum/maximum value?**

*   Limit motor output refers to quick instructions</br>

**Please let us know that the rated current of the motor is 12 A, but when we tested with the upper computer, it has reached more than 20 A. Is this normal?**

*   The current displayed by the host computer is the phase current, and the rated current is the bus current.</br>

**What is the frequency of the internal encoder acquisition of the motor?**

*   We use internal data at 20K to send actual speed according to your demand rate. The faster the communication bandwidth, the faster.

**Is the unit (R) inside the position mode meaning that the motor inside turns one turn?**

*   Yes, for (QDD-3510-36) turns inside and 10 degrees outside (QDD-3510-36) will turn.</br>

**What is the speed unit that the motor reads out?**

*   rpm, turn per minute Revolutionsperminute</br>

**Is the speed displayed by the upper Machine controlling the rotor speed?**

*   Yes, to calculate the output speed need proportional conversion</br>

**The stall energy setting does not go in?**

*   Set the carriage return and save</br>

## Operation problems

**How to control the speed in current mode?**

*   The speed cannot be controlled in the current mode, only the maximum speed can be limited, and the limit is limited.

**How to clear the motor stall error after the motor is blocked?**

*   Click the ClearErrors button
